# About Me

I’m a passionate PhD student in statistics, always striving to answer real-world questions through data.
My academic journey has been driven by a deep love for understanding complex problems,
and I balance that with my enthusiasm for calisthenics and scientific divulgation.
In fact, I had the possibility to work for [Instagram page dedicated to statistics](https://www.instagram.com/datajournalice?igsh=MTJwdHBiY3FpbjVvYg==) where I share interesting insights and engage with the community about the beauty of statistical modelling.

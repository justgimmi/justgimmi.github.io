# About Me

![Rick and Morty image](/images/rick.jfif){: .align-right width="320px"}


I am a passionate PhD student in statistics, driven by the desire to apply data to solve real-world problems.
My journey through academia has been fueled by a fascination for complex challenges.
I also balance my academic pursuits with my love for calisthenics, which helps me maintain focus and discipline.


As part of my commitment to scientific divulgation, I collaborate with [DataJournalice](https://www.instagram.com/datajournalice?igsh=MTJwdHBiY3FpbjVvYg==) trying to demistify where I work to demystify the complexities 
of this fascinating subject. Feel free to explore the page and reach out if you'd like to discuss any of the insights we share!

# Research Interests

My research focuses on Bayesian statistics and computational statistics,
with a particular focus in stochastic processes and geospatial statistics.


I'm fascinated by the way these fields allow us to model uncertainty and extract meaningful information
from complex data structures. Just to have an idea,
you can explore my biggest works up until now through my [Bachelor's thesis](/files/Tesi_Triennale.pdf), [Italian Master's thesis](/files/Tesi_Magistrale.pdf) and [French Master's thesis](/files/Final_Project.pdf).

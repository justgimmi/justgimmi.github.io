I am a passionate PhD student in statistics, driven by the desire to apply data to solve real-world problems.
My journey through academia has been fueled by a fascination for complex challenges.
I also balance my academic pursuits with my love for calisthenics, which helps me maintain focus and discipline.


As part of my commitment to scientific divulgation, I collaborate with [DataJournalice](https://www.instagram.com/datajournalice?igsh=MTJwdHBiY3FpbjVvYg==) trying to demistify where I work to demystify the complexities 
of this fascinating subject. Feel free to explore the page and reach out if you'd like to discuss any of the insights we share!

# Research Interests

My research focuses on Bayesian statistics (MCMC, Mixture and Dynamic modelling)
,computational statistics, and their application to stochastic processes and geospatial data analysis.


You can explore my previous works:

- [Bachelor's thesis](/files/Tesi_Triennale.pdf), focused on the probabilistic explanation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm;
- [Italian Master's thesis](/files/Tesi_Magistrale.pdf), presenting a new document clustering algorithm based on a bootstrap p-value approach;
- [French Master's thesis](/files/Final_Project.pdf), an initial attempt to model football results using random effects and dynamic Bayesian models.

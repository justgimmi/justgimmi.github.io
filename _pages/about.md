# About Me

![Rick and Morty image](/images/rick.jfif){: .align-right width="320px"}


I’m a passionate PhD student in statistics, always striving to answer real-world questions through data.


My academic journey has been driven by a deep love for understanding complex problems,
and I balance that with my enthusiasm for calisthenics and scientific divulgation.
In fact, I had the possibility to work for [DataJournalice](https://www.instagram.com/datajournalice?igsh=MTJwdHBiY3FpbjVvYg==) where I share interesting insights and engage with the community about the beauty of statistical modelling.



# Research Interests

![CC](/images/Cowboy.png){: .align-center width="360px"}

My research focuses on Bayesian statistics and computational statistics,
with a particular focus in stochastic processes and geospatial statistics.


I'm fascinated by the way these fields allow us to model uncertainty and extract meaningful information
from complex data structures. Just to have an idea,
you can explore my biggest works up until now through my [Bachelor's thesis](/files/Tesi_Triennale.pdf), [Italian Master's thesis](/files/Tesi_Magistrale.pdf) and [French Master's thesis](/files/Final_Project.pdf).
